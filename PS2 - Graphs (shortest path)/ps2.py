# Problem 2a: Designing your graph
#
# What do the graph's nodes represent in this problem? What
# do the graph's edges represent? Where are the distances
# represented?
#
# Answer:
# The graph's nodes represent buildings on the MIT campus. The edges represent 
# The edges represent a path from one building to another, and they have two 
# weights: the toal distance of the path and the distance of the path spent
# outdoors.
